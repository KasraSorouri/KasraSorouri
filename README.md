- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KasraSorouri 
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m Digital Transformation Assistance and Business Analyst 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Problem solving and learning new Things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m doing full stack project using Node.js, Express, SpringBoot and React. 

<h2>About me</h2>
I have been following my interest in the field of IT and have been active as an ICDL Teacher, Domain Administrator, Software Designer, IT Manager and IT Consultant. I effectively utilize my IT Knowledge and skills and bring them to my working environment and improve its processes and productivity.

I have nearly 20 years of experience in several industries, including Car Manufacturing, Mechanical Equipment and Spare Parts Supply, Electrical Switchgear Manufacturing, and Installation and Commissioning of Steel Production Equipment. 

I have a can-do attitude and a passion for learning new things. I love things that challenge my mind. It makes no difference what the issue is a software bug, a hardware fault, a technical flaw with the equipment or 
incompatible policies, an inefficient organizational process, or anything else.; I always find a good solution to the problem or improve the situation. (This is why I love programming)

My aspiration is to use all the skills mentioned above to help companies find the best software tailored to their processes. I am eager to help companies be more successful and have a smoother digital transformation.
