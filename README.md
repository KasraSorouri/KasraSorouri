<h2>About me</h2>
I'm passionate about Manufacturing, IT, and driving Process and Product Improvements. Combining these interests, I've leveraged my IT Skills to enhance Manufacturing Operations.

I studied Mechanical Engineering at university and pursued my education in the Master of Executive Management. I love learning and continuously update my IT knowledge through self-learning and various courses.

My diverse experience across different levels and departments in various industries has given me a profound understanding of organizational processes. Combining this with my strong problem-solving skills, I excel in translating stakeholders' requirements into technical documents and crafting effective technological solutions.
	
I moved to Finland in Aug 2021, and since then, I have been learning Finnish and acquired my B1 certificate, and now I can handle everyday conversations. I also updated my other skills by enrolling in several courses.

My inspiration and primary goal is to assist businesses in enhancing their operations and boosting productivity. 

Please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasra-sorouri). 
Hopefully, we can find a common ground for cooperation.
