<h2>About me</h2>
I received a master's in EMBA after studying mechanical engineering. I work as a business process improvement consultant in addition to having several years of experience as a manager in a medium-sized company and previously as a vehicle engineer expert at car manufacturer. However, my interest in the IT domain led me to develop my IT skills as a hobby and use them to efficiently handle work-related challenges.
I have a can-do attitude and I love things that challenge my mind. (This is why I love programming)
