<h2>About me</h2>
I have been following my interest in the field of IT and have been active as an ICDL Teacher, Domain Administrator, Software Designer, IT Manager and IT Consultant. Although my previous positions were in various industries, I have always used my strong IT and programming skills to help businesses during their digital transformation. I got my hands dirty assessing, designing, creating, and implementing various applications to meet their present and future needs.

I have 20+ years of experience in several industries, including Car Manufacturing, Mechanical Equipment and Spare Parts Supply, Electrical Switchgear Manufacturing, and Installation and Commissioning of Steel Production Equipment. Moreover, because of my passion for improving things, I worked as a business process improvement consultant. 

Learning new things is an intrinsic part of my personality. I excel at combining various knowledge and skills to resolve problems and create plans that meet current and future needs or improve something.My firm belief is “There is always a solution; I will find it or make it, no matter how difficult it is.”   

I desire to use all my skills and experiences to help companies find the best software tailored to their processes. I am eager to help companies be more successful and have a smoother digital transformation.
