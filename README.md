## Turning manufacturing needs into smart software solutions
 👋 Hi, I’m <b> @KasraSorouri </b> </br>
 ✨ I’m a Business Analyst and Solution Architect, helping businesses on their digital transformation journey. </br>
 💡 I love solving problems, fixing things, and learning every day — that’s why programming excites me. </br>
 🎯 I spend my free time learning, practicing, and building software projects as a hobby, always exploring new tools and ideas. </br>

## About Me
I’m passionate about <b> manufacturing, IT, and improving processes and products </b>. </br>
With hands-on experience in manufacturing and organizations, I understand their needs and speak their language. In the past, I often acted as a bridge between organizations and software vendors, making sure both sides worked together smoothly. </br>
I studied Mechanical Engineering and later earned a Master’s in Executive Management. Along the way, I discovered how much I enjoy combining engineering with IT. </br>
📚 I’m always learning, from self-study, courses, and hands-on projects. </br>
